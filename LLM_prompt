Prompt for spiral maze, with initial position at (3,3) and exit at (5,6):

maze_layout =   [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
               [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
        """Initialize the maze game with a given layout."""

0 is open path, and 1 is wall.

You initial position is at (3,3). And your exit is at (5,6). Do not use algorithms. Check each time if there is a wall. If there is a wall and then comes back. Plan using language. Explain your reasoning. Please provide me the linguistic plan to exit the maze. You are allow to take up to 50 steps.
